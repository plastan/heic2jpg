If the source directory is not specified, the current working directory will be used. If the destination directory is not specified. a result folder will be created in the current working directory.

Replace `source_dir` and `destination_dir` with the directories containing the HEIC files and the destination directory for the converted JPG files, respectively.

## Example:
